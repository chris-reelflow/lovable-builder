I wanted to reach back out because what Birdie is building really resonates with me. You’re tackling one of the hardest challenges in homecare — making technology feel personal, trustworthy, and simple for carers and families.  That’s exactly why we built ReelFlow. Buyers don’t just want another brochure or PDF — they want to see the people behind the product, understand how it works, and feel the impact. And Birdie has an incredible story to tell: your Carer App, your analytics, your mission to create a true ‘Village of Care’.  With ReelFlow, we help you turn that story into short, interactive videos that build trust with carers, families, and providers. I would love to chat again to see how we can work together on this. Thanks! Chat soon! ","✅ Video generated"
